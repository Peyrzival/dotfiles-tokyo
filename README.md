## Important
 * Fonts needed: Space Mono NF (i recommend this [pre-release version](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)), material design icons and feather icons (included in directory usr/)
 * Music player: i use [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui), my config for colors is not perfect but i tried.
 * if you want, you can use [sptlrx](https://github.com/raitonoberu/sptlrx) for lyrics in your terminal, works great with a combination of spotify-tui and sptlrx.
 * Change some values in polybar like wlan for your specific wifi adapter, battery module, etc.
 * to modify firefox follow this [instructions](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade#how-to-use-a-userchromecss-theme), specifically the about:config part
 * to complete firefox modification, place the directory chrome in ~/.mozilla/firefox/your_release.default-release/ 
 * my [startpage](https://peyrzival.github.io/startpage/), to put it as a new tab in firefox use this [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
 * my text editor is doom emacs, i use the [distro tube config](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles)
 * put the directory bin/ in $HOME/.local/, is necessary for some keybindings to work
